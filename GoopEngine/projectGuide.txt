[ Solution ]
.NET Framework 4.8 MUST BE INSTALLED to run the project (for scripting)
On startup, either select debug or release mode
For target, set to x64 instead of "Any CPU"

[ ErrorLogging ]
Errors are logged into Imgui console and to a file
Dumped log file is named after the time of program

[ Multiple Animations ]
Animations do not begin playing until simulation is started

[ Prefab Editor ]
Upon saving the changes, all instances created from that prefab in the scene are updated with the prefab's components.
If the entity does not currently exist in the scene, it will be updated when it is loaded to reflect the changes accordingly.

[ Images ]
Only exclusively supports 32 bit depth png images.

[ Game Release ]
Game release mode can be built via the configurations and has ImGui disabled when building in this mode
