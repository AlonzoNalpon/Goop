[ Solution ]
.NET Framework 4.72 MUST BE INSTALLED to run the project (for scripting)
On startup, either select debug or release mode
For target, set to x64 instead of "Any CPU"

[ Scenes ]
Program starts at a sample scene
Press right arrow to switch to testing scene
Press left to switch back

[ ErrorLogging ]
Errors are logged into Imgui console and to a file
Dumped log file is named after the time of program

[ Multiple Animations ]
Animations do not begin playing until simulation is started

[ Prefab Editor ]
Upon saving the changes, all instances created from that prefab in the scene are updated with the prefab's components.
If the entity does not currently exist in the scene, it will be updated when it is loaded to reflect the changes accordingly.

To test:
  1. Head to PrefabTest.scn.
  2. Drag either "Mineworm" or "TestBtn" from "Prefabs" directory into the prefab editor window
  3. Add any new components or modify existing components.
  4. Save Changes
  5. Changes should now be reflected on the existing entities in the scene. (except for the 2 entities that weren't created from the prefab)
  Additionally, you can drag an existing prefab into the scene, then modify it after. The same behaviour should be seen.

  E.g. you can add Button component to TestBtn prefab and save to give all buttons that component


[ Disable ImGui ]
ImGui can be disabled by including the code "#define NO_IMGUI" in pch.h
The program is not fully seperated from ImGui and may result in undefined behaviour
