[ Asset Browser ]
Directory holds all folders and sub folders within Asset Directory.
Displays files within each folder selected from Directory. Images are printed for .png files.
Drag and Drop:
1. images and prefab file into viewport.
2. images to scene hierarchy.

[ Node Editor ]
Allows user to edit enemy's behaviour tree. Any changes made will be displayed in the game at runtime, if the tree is valid (will explain more about it bellow)
There are 3 types of nodes available, Root Node, Composite Node and Leaf Node (Each of them are displayed with a different colored heading)
There are 2 types of pins, Input Pin (Left Pin) and the Output Pin (Right pin). 
Currently, you can navigate around the node editor by holding the middle mouse button and move your mouse around.
Would reccomend you to load the BehaviourTreeTest scene to see the enemy use the behaviour tree

Users are able to perform these actions:
1. Reposition the nodes
2. Link/Unlink nodes through the pins to create a parent/child relationship
   - A link is made by connecting an output pin to an input pin. The outpin represents the parent in the relationship while the inputpin represents the child in the relationship. 
   - To Form a link click on thepin and drag it to the other pin. Same thing if you want to remove the link
   - Root Node only has output pin as in can only be a parent, Composite Node has both output and input as it can be a parent and a child at the same time and the Leaf Node only has an input pin has it can only be a 
     child
3. Attach Scripts to a node
   - You can attach 1 script to each node. Each node has a box that shows the name of the script attached to node. when you click on the box, it will show a list of all the scripts you can attach to the node
   - In order for the tree to run as a behaviour tree, you will Root Node should only have the "RootNode" script and your Composite Nodes should only have the "SelectorNode" or "SeqeunceNode" scripts. You can attach 
      the rest of the other scripts to the leaf nodes
   - If you try to attach other scripts to it, the tree will still run, but not as a behaviour tree
4. Add Node
   - If you did not select any nodes and click the right mouse button, you will be able to see 3 options (Add root Node, Add composite Node, Add leaf node)
   - By selecting any of these 3 options, it will spawn a new empty node with no script. If you have any nodes with no scripts, it will not update the behaviour tree in game. So you should attach a script to it 
     after create the new node ( Do please attach the right script)
5. Edit Node
   - If you select a node and click the right mouse button, you will be able to see the "delete node" option and any 2 of these ("Change to root Node, Change to composite node, Change to leaf node") options based on 
     the type of node you select. e.g. (If you select the root node, you will only see ("delete node, change to composite node, change to leaf node"))
   - If you choose to change the node type, it will remove any links the node had, but the script remains unchanged.
   - If you choose to delete the node, it will remove the node and any links it had

[ Prefab Editor ]
Allows a new prefab to be created (through file explorer) on right-click
Drag and drop is supported from Assets Browser window
