In the game scene:
You can queue and unqueue up to 3 cards by clicking the cards in the player's hand and then press end turn to resolve the turn.
The cards will be resolved, affecting the player and enemy's health.
Each card will have their own animations, i.e. Leah's Beam card will play Leah's Beam animation.
Two adjacent selected cards will form a card combo.
The combos will be applied after the resolution of the 2 cards.
The combo effect will be displayed for a brief moment as text beside the queued cards.
An icon for buffs and debuffs applied will appear above the character's respective health bar.
Hovering over the icons will display text to show the type of buff.
The turn ends once all cards and combos are resolved.

Note: The game stores the save file under "Documents\Goop\DungeonPlunder\" directory
