In the cutscenes:
By pressing Left Mouse Button, you can move to the next scene.

In the game scene:
You can queue and unqueue up to 3 cards by clicking the cards in the player's hand and then press end turn to resolve the turn.
The cards will be resolved, affecting the player and enemy's health.
Each card will have their own animations, i.e. Leah's Beam card will play Leah's Beam animation.
Two adjacent selected cards will form a card combo.
The combos will be applied after the resolution of the 2 cards.
The combo effect will be displayed for a brief moment as text beside the queued cards.
An icon for buffs and debuffs applied will appear above the character's respective health bar.
Hovering over the icons will display text to show the type of buff.
The turn ends once all cards and combos are resolved.

Pausing:
Pausing the game stops the audio as per rubric, but we also have audio controls in the options menu which now serve no purpose

Controls:
On the editor/engine, Pressing "G" when viewport is focused will hide the editor.
"F11" on both gameplay and editor can toggle fullscreen modes

Cheats (in game scene):
Pressing "U" will reduce the enemy's health by 1.
Pressing "I" will heal the player's health by 1.
Pressing "O" will draw an additional card (note that max hand size is 5)

Known bugs:
Pressing hotkeys like "Esc" and "U" during the game sometimes do not detect the input, due to C# running on a seperate thread. (Help)
Environment effects sometimes vanishes
Load Game will not work if "New Game" has not been clicked before as we have not fully implemented this feature.
It will only work once you get past the tutorial.
